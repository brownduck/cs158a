To run this program, run the myvlserver first and then run the myvlclient. If myvlclient throws an error, it is most liekly because myvlserver didn't run first. 
Then, input a number and a string in one line, the number representing the side of the string. The server should return the string with the specified length.

Example inputs include: '2hi', '6fries', '8
Below are some of the outputs from client and server from the test cases:
